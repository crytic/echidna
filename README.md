# Echidna: A Fast Smart Contract Fuzzer <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crytic/echidna/master/echidna.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crytic/echidna/master/echidna.png" width="75"/></a>

![Build Status](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Echidna is a weird creature that eats bugs and is highly electrosensitive (with apologies to Jacob Stanley)

More seriously, Echidna is a Haskell program designed for fuzzing/property-based testing of Ethereum smart contracts. It uses sophisticated grammar-based fuzzing campaigns based on a [contract ABI](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/abi-spec.html) to falsify user-defined predicates or [Solidity assertions](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/control-structures.html#id4). We designed Echidna with modularity in mind, so it can be easily extended to include new mutations or test specific contracts in specific cases.

## Features

* Generates inputs tailored to your actual code
* Optional corpus collection, mutation and coverage guidance to find deeper bugs
* Powered by [Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) to extract useful information before the fuzzing campaign
* Source code integration to identify which lines are covered after the fuzzing campaign
* Curses-based retro UI, text-only or JSON output
* Automatic test case minimization for quick triage
* Seamless integration into the development workflow
* Maximum gas usage reporting of the fuzzing campaign
* Support for a complex contract initialization with [Etheno](https://github.com/crytic/etheno) and Truffle

.. and [a beautiful high-resolution handcrafted logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crytic/echidna/master/echidna.png).

## Usage

### Executing the test runner

The core Echidna functionality is an executable called `echidna`. `echidna` takes a contract and a list of invariants (properties that should always remain true) as input. For each invariant, it generates random sequences of calls to the contract and checks if the invariant holds. If it can find some way to falsify the invariant, it prints the call sequence that does so. If it can't, you have some assurance the contract is safe.

### Writing invariants

Invariants are expressed as Solidity functions with names that begin with `echidna_`, have no arguments, and return a boolean. For example, if you have some `balance` variable that should never go below `20`, you can write an extra function in your contract like this one:

```solidity
function echidna_check_balance() public returns (bool) {
    return(balance >= 20);
}
```

To check these invariants, run:

```sh
$ echidna myContract.sol
```

An example contract with tests can be found [tests/solidity/basic/flags.sol](tests/solidity/basic/flags.sol). To run it, you should execute:

```sh
$ echidna tests/solidity/basic/flags.sol
```

Echidna should find a call sequence that falsifies `echidna_sometimesfalse` and should be unable to find a falsifying input for `echidna_alwaystrue`.

### Collecting and visualizing coverage

After finishing a campaign, Echidna can save a coverage maximizing **corpus** in a special directory specified with the `corpusDir` config option. This directory will contain two entries: (1) a directory named `coverage` with JSON files that can be replayed by Echidna and (2) a plain-text file named `covered.txt`, a copy of the source code with coverage annotations.

If you run `tests/solidity/basic/flags.sol` example, Echidna will save a few files serialized transactions in the `coverage` directory and a `covered.$(date +%s).txt` file with the following lines:

```text
*r  |  function set0(int val) public returns (bool){
*   |    if (val % 100 == 0)
*   |      flag0 = false;
  }

*r  |  function set1(int val) public returns (bool){
*   |    if (val % 10 == 0 && !flag0)
*   |      flag1 = false;
  }
```

Our tool signals each execution trace in the corpus with the following "line marker":

* `*` if an execution ended with a STOP
* `r` if an execution ended with a REVERT
* `o` if an execution ended with an out-of-gas error
* `e` if an execution ended with any other error (zero division, assertion failure, etc)

### Support for smart contract build systems

Echidna can test contracts compiled with different smart contract build systems, including [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/) or [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) using [crytic-compile](https://github.com/crytic/crytic-compile). To invoke echidna with the current compilation framework, use `echidna .`.

On top of that, Echidna supports two modes of testing complex contracts. Firstly, one can [describe an initialization procedure with Truffle and Etheno](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/blob/master/program-analysis/echidna/end-to-end-testing.md) and use that as the base state for Echidna. Secondly, echidna can call into any contract with a known ABI by passing in the corresponding solidity source in the CLI. Use `multi-abi: true` in your config to turn this on.

### Crash course on Echidna

Our [Building Secure Smart Contracts](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/program-analysis/echidna#echidna-tutorial) repository contains a crash course on Echidna, including examples, lessons and exercises.

### Using Echidna in a GitHub Actions workflow

There is an Echidna action which can be used to run `echidna` as part of a
GitHub Actions workflow. Please refer to the
[crytic/echidna-action](https://github.com/crytic/echidna-action) repository for
usage instructions and examples.

### Configuration options

Echidna's CLI can be used to choose the contract to test and load a
configuration file.

```sh
$ echidna contract.sol --contract TEST --config config.yaml
```

The configuration file allows users to choose EVM and test generation
parameters. An example of a complete and annotated config file with the default
options can be found at
[tests/solidity/basic/default.yaml](tests/solidity/basic/default.yaml).
More detailed documentation on the configuration options is available in our
[wiki](https://github.com/trailofbits/echidna/wiki/Config).

Echidna supports three different output drivers. There is the default `text`
driver, a `json` driver, and a `none` driver, which should suppress all
`stdout` output. The JSON driver reports the overall campaign as follows.

```json
Campaign = {
  "success"      : bool,
  "error"        : string?,
  "tests"        : [Test],
  "seed"         : number,
  "coverage"     : Coverage,
  "gas_info"     : [GasInfo]
}
Test = {
  "contract"     : string,
  "name"         : string,
  "status"       : string,
  "error"        : string?,
  "testType"     : string,
  "transactions" : [Transaction]?
}
Transaction = {
  "contract"     : string,
  "function"     : string,
  "arguments"    : [string]?,
  "gas"          : number,
  "gasprice"     : number
}
```

`Coverage` is a dict describing certain coverage-increasing calls.
Each `GasInfo` entry is a tuple that describes how maximal
gas usage was achieved, and is also not too important. These interfaces are
subject to change to be slightly more user-friendly at a later date. `testType`
will either be `property` or `assertion`, and `status` always takes on either
`fuzzing`, `shrinking`, `solved`, `passed`, or `error`.

### Debugging Performance Problems

The best way to deal with an Echidna performance issue is to run `echidna` with profiling on.
This creates a text file, `echidna.prof`, which shows which functions take up the most CPU and memory usage.

To build a version of `echidna` that supports profiling, either Stack or Nix should be used.
With Stack, adding the flag `--profile` will make the build support profiling.
With Nix, running `nix-build --arg profiling true` will make the build support profiling.

To run with profiling on, add the flags `+RTS -p` to your original `echidna` command.

Performance issues in the past have been because of functions getting called repeatedly when they could be memoized,
and memory leaks related to Haskell's lazy evaluation;
checking for these would be a good place to start.

## Limitations and known issues

EVM emulation and testing are hard. Echidna has some limitations in the latest release. Some of these are inherited from [hevm](https://github.com/dapphub/dapptools/tree/master/src/hevm) while some are results from design/performance decisions or simply bugs in our code. We list them here including their corresponding issue and the status ("wont fix", "on hold", "in review", "fixed"). Issues that are "fixed" are expected to be included in the next Echidna release.

| Description |  Issue   | Status   |
| :--- |     :---:              |         :---:   |
| Vyper support is limited | [#652](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/issues/652) | *wont fix* |
| Limited library support for testing | [#651](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/issues/651) | *wont fix* |
| Lack of support for function pointers in Solidity | [#798](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/issues/798) | *on hold* |
## Installation

### Precompiled binaries

Before starting, make sure Slither is [installed](https://github.com/crytic/slither) (`pip3 install slither-analyzer --user`).
If you want to quickly test Echidna in Linux or MacOS, we provide statically linked Linux binaries built on Ubuntu and mostly static MacOS binaries on our [releases page](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/releases). You can also grab the same type of binaries from our [CI pipeline](https://github.com/crytic/echidna/actions?query=workflow%3ACI+branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush), just click the commit to find binaries for Linux or MacOS.

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

If you have Homebrew installed on your Mac or Linux machine, you can install Echidna and all of its dependencies (Slither, crytic-compile) by running `brew install echidna`.

You can also compile and install the latest `master` branch code by running `brew install --HEAD echidna`

You can get further information in the [`echidna` Homebrew Formula](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/echidna) page. The formula itself is maintained as part of the [homebrew-core repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/echidna.rb)

### Docker container

If you prefer to use a pre-built Docker container, check out our [docker
package](https://github.com/orgs/crytic/packages?repo_name=echidna), which is
auto-built via GitHub Actions. The `echidna` container is based on
`ubuntu:focal` and it is meant to be a small yet flexible enough image to use
Echidna on. It provides a pre-built version of `echidna`, as well as
`slither`, `crytic-compile`, `solc-select` and `nvm` under 200 MB.

Note that the container images currently only build on x86 systems. Running them
on ARM devices, such as Mac M1 systems, is not recommended due to the performance
loss incurred by the CPU emulation.

Different tags are available for the Docker container image:

| Tag           | Build in tag
|---------------|-------------
| `vx.y.z`      | Build corresponding to release `vx.y.z`
| `latest`      | Latest Echidna tagged release.
| `edge`        | Most recent commit on the default branch.
| `testing-foo` | Testing build based on the `foo` branch.

To run the container with the latest Echidna version interactively, you can use
something like the following command. It will map the current directory as
`/src` inside the container, and give you a shell where you can use
`echidna`:

```sh
$ docker run --rm -it -v `pwd`:/src ghcr.io/crytic/echidna/echidna
```

Otherwise, if you want to locally build the latest version of Echidna, we
recommend using Docker. From within a clone of this repository, run the
following command to build the Docker container image:

```sh
$ docker build -t echidna -f docker/Dockerfile --target final-ubuntu .
```

Then, you can run the `echidna` image locally. For example, to install solc
0.5.7 and check `tests/solidity/basic/flags.sol`, you can run:

```sh
$ docker run -it -v `pwd`:/src echidna bash -c "solc-select install 0.5.7 && solc-select use 0.5.7 && echidna /src/tests/solidity/basic/flags.sol"
```

### Building using Stack

If you'd prefer to build from source, use [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/). `stack install` should build and compile `echidna` in `~/.local/bin`. You will need to link against libreadline and libsecp256k1 (built with recovery enabled), which should be installed with the package manager of your choosing. You also need to install the latest release of [libff](https://github.com/scipr-lab/libff). Refer to our [CI tests](.github/scripts/install-libff.sh) for guidance.

Some Linux distributions do not ship static libraries for certain things that Haskell needs, e.g. Arch Linux, which will cause `stack build` to fail with linking errors because we use the `-static` flag. In that case, use `--flag echidna:-static` to produce a dynamically linked binary.

If you're getting errors building related to linking, try tinkering with `--extra-include-dirs` and `--extra-lib-dirs`.

### Building using Nix (works natively on Apple M1 systems)

[Nix users](https://nixos.org/download.html) can install the latest Echidna with:

```sh
$ nix-env -i -f https://github.com/crytic/echidna/tarball/master
```

To build a standalone release for non-Nix macOS systems, the following will
bundle Echidna and all linked dylibs in a tarball:

```sh
$ nix-build macos-release.nix
$ ll result/
bin    echidna-1.7.3-aarch64-darwin.tar.gz
```

It is possible to develop Echidna with Cabal inside `nix-shell`. Nix will automatically
install all the dependencies required for development including `crytic-compile` and `solc`.
A quick way to get GHCi with Echidna ready for work:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/crytic/echidna
$ cd echidna
$ nix-shell
[nix-shell]$ cabal new-repl
```

Running the test suite:

```sh
nix-shell --run 'cabal test'
```
